# `magic-eight-ball` Repository

> The `magic-eight-ball` repository is a very simple RESTful API written in the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/) 
> and using the [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/). The goal is to provide a URI which contains all 20 
> of the original [Magic 8-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-ball) answers, plus a second URI will provide a 
> random answer - to mimic the functionality of the original toy manufactured by [Mattel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel).

## Starting the `magic-eight-ball` Repository

With the Go programming language installed, simply use the following command to start the simply RESTful API:

```shell
go run .
```

The service should start, providing information similar to what is displayed below:

```shell

## Using the `magic-eight-ball` Repository

Simply perform GET requests to the following URIs:

* /answers - provides a list of all 20 original Magic 8-ball answers
* /answer - returns a random answer from the 20 original Magic 8-ball options

For example, the following request:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/answer
```

Could return the following response:

```json
{
    "id": 5,
    "response": "You may rely on it."
}%
```
